# Overview

This is a simple graphics-based maze game that presents the player with a simple educational trivia question and four 'answers' that can be selected by exiting the current 'room' in a cardinal direction. The goal of this program is to provide children with a simple and engaging way to learn.

# Development Environment

To develop this program, we used Pygame and MySQL Database. We also used the mysql connector library to move data between the two.

# Collaborators

Our team consisted of

* Matthew Unsworth
* Sandro Dinklang
* V. Adrian Castillo
* Torin Bolander

# Useful Websites

* [MySQL Python Connector documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/)
* [pygame documentation](https://www.pygame.org/news)

# Future Work

* We wanted to add Computer Science questions, but that would've required that we add image support for answers.
* Music!
* ...and better animations.
